// Pseudocode
// Hangman begins, a word is picked, and underlines appear on the screen for the amount of letters in that word. no characters appear
// user guesses the letters in the word by typing on the key board
// user gets 12 guesses before game is over
// if user guesses a letter that's in the word, that letter appears where it's respective underline was (or underlineS). guesses decreases by 1
// if user guesses incorrectly, guesses decreases by one, and letter appears under 'guessed letters' section
// if user repeats an already guessed letter, nothing happens. no deduction from guesses occurs
// if user guesses all letters correctly before guesses run out, display that they win
// if user depletes guesses before word is picked, game over. display that they lose, and display correct answer
