## Motivation

Expanding on my front end foudations of HTML and CSS by incorporating JavaScript. This is my first project with JS included.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- HTML
- CSS
- Google Fonts
- JavaScript

## Features

The UI of my project is meant to replicate a hockey rink, with all of the game action taking place within a hockey net. Sound effects are present to enhance user experience, and user input validation is used to ensure that the user doesn't double guess a letter or accidentally guess a key that isn't in the English alphabet. The game keeps a running tally of wins and letters guessed, and a new game will begin without needing to refresh the page.

## How to use?

Easy! Open the link, press the spacebar to start the game, and key letters on your keyboard to guess the word! Hint...hockey players last names typically aren't vowel friendly...
